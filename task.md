## Casino Transaction Management System

### Overview

You are tasked with building a simple transaction management system for a casino. The system will track user transactions related to their bets and wins. The transactions will be processed asynchronously via a message system, and the data will be stored in a relational database. You will also need to expose an API to allow querying of transaction data.

---

## Key Components

### 1. Message System

- **Choice**: Kafka or RabbitMQ
- **Purpose**: The system will receive transaction data (bet/win events) as messages, which need to be processed and saved in the database.

### 2. Database

- **Choice**: PostgreSQL or MySQL
- **Purpose**: Store the transaction data

**Transaction fields:**
- `user_id` - The ID of the user making the transaction
- `transaction_type` - Either "bet" or "win"
- `amount` - The amount of money for the transaction
- `timestamp` - The time the transaction occurred

### 3. Transaction API

- **Purpose**: Allow clients to query transaction data
- **Features**:
  - Query for a single user or all transactions
  - Support filtering by transaction type (bet, win, or all transactions)

---

## Requirements

### 1. Message Consumer

- ✅ Create a message consumer that listens for messages (bet/win transactions) from the chosen message system (Kafka or RabbitMQ)
- ✅ The consumer must process the messages asynchronously and store the transaction details in the chosen database

### 2. Database

- ✅ Set up the database schema to store the transaction data

### 3. API

- ✅ Implement the API in Go
- ✅ The API must allow users to query their transaction history
- ✅ Support filtering by `transaction_type` (bet, win, or all)
- ✅ Ensure the API returns the transactions in JSON format

### 4. Testing

- ✅ Write unit and integration tests for all components
- ✅ Test coverage should be at least **85%**

### 5. Documentation

- ✅ Provide a README file with any relevant instructions
